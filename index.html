        <h2>The Rise of the Internet</h2>
        <p>
            Over the past few decades, the number of people with access to the internet has increased dramatically.
            Once a rare luxury limited to a small fraction of the population, internet access has become an essential
            part of everyday life -- connecting people across continents, transforming economies, and reshaping how
            information flows globally. Want to know more? Click

                As countries become more urbanized, access to infrastructure such as electricity, broadband, and mobile
                networks typically expands. This relationship often leads to higher internet adoption rates in areas with greater
                urban populations. The scatter plot below illustrates this connection, showing how nations with higher
                urbanization rates tend to have a larger share of their populations using the internet.

        Taken together, these visualizations highlight how internet access has grown from a rare luxury into a global
        necessity, but also how uneven that growth remains. Highly urbanized and economically developed nations tend to
        enjoy widespread connectivity, while countries with lower GDP or less urban infrastructure often lag behind.
        Understanding these patterns helps reveal not only where progress has been made, but also where investments in
        technology, education, and infrastructure can make the most meaningful impact. As the world becomes
        increasingly digital, closing these gaps will be essential to ensuring that all communities can participate
        fully in the global information economy.
